"
" Introduction
" ------------
"
" This is a simple script that shows a tabs-like list of buffers in the bottom
" of the window. The biggest advantage of this script over various others is
" that it does not take any lines away from your terminal, leaving more space
" for the document you're editing. The tabs are only visible when you need
" them - when you are switchin between buffers.
"
" Usage
" -----
" 
" This script draws buffer tabs on vim startup, when a new buffer is created
" and when switching between buffers.
"
" It might be handy to create a few maps for easy switching of buffers in your
" .vimrc file. For example, using F1 and F2 keys:
"
"   noremap <f1> :bprev<CR> 
"   noremap <f2> :bnext<CR>
"
" or using control-left and control-right keys:
"
"   :noremap <C-left> :bprev<CR>
"   :noremap <C-right> :bnext<CR>
"
"
" The following extra configuration variables are availabe:
" 
" * g:buftabs_only_basename
"
"   Define this variable to make buftabs only print the filename of each buffer,
"   omitting the preceding directory name. Add to your .vimrc:
"
"   :let g:buftabs_only_basename=1
"
"
" * g:buftabs_in_statusline
"
"   Define this variable to make the plugin show the buftabs in the statusline
"   instead of the command line. It is a good idea to configure vim to show
"   the statusline as well when only one window is open. Add to your .vimrc:
"
"   set laststatus=2
"   :let g:buftabs_in_statusline=1
"    
"
" * g:buftabs_active_highlight_group
"
"   The name of a highlight group (:help highligh-groups) which is used to
"   show the name of the current active buffer. If this variable is not
"   defined, no highlighting is used. (Highlighting is only functional when 
"   g:buftabs_in_statusline is enabled)
"
"   :let g:buftabs_active_highlight_group="Visual"
"
"
" Bugs
" ----
"
" Vim's 'set hidden' option is known to break this plugin - for some reason
" vim will overwrite the buftabs when this option is enabled. 
"
"
" Changelog
" ---------
" 
" 0.1  2006-09-22  Initial version 
"
" 0.2  2006-09-22  Better handling when the list of buffers is longer then the
"                  window width.
"
" 0.3  2006-09-27  Some cleanups, set 'hidden' mode by default
"
" 0.4  2007-02-26  Don't draw buftabs until VimEnter event to avoid clutter at
"                  startup in some circumstances
"
" 0.5  2007-02-26  Added option for showing only filenames without directories
"                  in tabs
"
" 0.6  2007-03-04  'only_basename' changed to a global variable.  Removed
"                  functions and add event handlers instead.  'hidden' mode 
"                  broke some things, so is disabled now. Fixed documentation
"
" 0.7  2007-03-07  Added configuration option to show tabs in statusline
"                  instead of cmdline

"
" 0.9  2007-08-22  Now compatible with older Vim versions < 7.0
